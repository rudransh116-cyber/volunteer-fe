## Volunteer‑FE

A React web application that helps build community to raise awareness and improve social unity.

In the project, you can:

### 1) View Volunteer Opportunities and Community Events  
Present a curated list of local volunteer initiatives and social unity‑driven events in a clear, engaging interface.


### 2) Get Event Details and Volunteer Info  
Click any item to expand its details—such as date, location, description, and how to get involved.

---

###  Built With:
- *React* (bootstrapped via Create React App) ([github.com](https://github.com/rudransh116-cyber/volunteer-fe))  
- *JavaScript, **CSS, **HTML*
- Likely using *Fetch API* or similar to retrieve volunteer/event data (network‑fetching logic if included)

---

### Available Scripts

From the project root directory:

| Command         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| npm start    | Runs the app in development mode. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use it locally. The page reloads on changes and shows lint/console feedback. ([github.com](https://github.com/rudransh116-cyber/volunteer-fe)) |
| npm test     | Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the React documentation for details. ([github.com](https://github.com/rudransh116-cyber/volunteer-fe)) |
| npm run build| Builds the app for production into the build/ folder. Bundles React in production mode with filename hashing for optimal caching. ([github.com](https://github.com/rudransh116-cyber/volunteer-fe)) |
| npm run eject| *Caution:* This is a one‑way operation. It copies all config files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control—you’ll then manage them yourself. ([github.com](https://github.com/rudransh116-cyber/volunteer-fe)) |
